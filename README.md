## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me
In tech, I wear a few hats - **Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and Problem Solver**. But everything I do comes down to one thing:  
👉 **enabling teams to trust, use, and act on data with confidence.**

Over the past **6+ years**, I’ve built solutions at the intersection of **data engineering, applied AI, and enterprise-scale systems**:
- Designed **resilient ETL/ELT pipelines** and **medallion architectures** across Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse, and Delta Lake.  
- Led **secure enterprise access governance** using Entra ID, streamlining data access for 10,000+ business users globally.  
- Developed **machine learning pipelines** for biometric verification, fraud detection, and deepfake detection — driving accuracy and robustness in digital KYC.  
- Explored **AI for sustainability**, including remote sensing & precision agriculture, with a focus on **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**.  

I’ve had the privilege of contributing to impactful organizations like the **World Bank Group, Smile ID, AmaliTech, University of Ghana, Creion, and Carnegie Mellon University**. Along the way, I have seen firsthand how **data and AI can transform industries and lives.**

## 🔹 Beyond Work
Outside my 7–4 role, I:  
- Run **ScholarsBackPack**, a resume + application review service that has supported professionals across Ghana, Spain, the UK, Nigeria, the US, Kenya, Tanzania, and India.  
- Invest in **agribusiness ventures**, staying close to my long-term interest in **AI + agriculture for food security**.  
- Contribute to communities empowering **women in tech**, mentorship, and IoT innovation.
